# Wrap-Text-By-Line
Do you have a large text node that's line-wrapped into several lines, and you'd like split/target each individual line? This JavaScript library will add wrapper tags around each line for you.

## Installation
There are two npm options for adding Wrap Text By Line to your JS project. First run `'wrap-text-by-line`, then include in your code using 'require' or 'import'.
* `const { WrapTextByLine } = require 'wrap-text-by-line';`
* `import WrapTextByLine from 'wrap-text-by-line';`

You can also include Wrap Text By Line directly in the head of an html page:
* `<script src="https://unpkg.com/wrap-text-by-line"></script>`
